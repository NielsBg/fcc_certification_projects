          <p>What is the console on CS2 and why should you use it?</p>
          <p>The console is just that. A console. It's a feature of nearly all of Valve's games that utilize the Source Engine. 
            <ul>
            <li>A way for players to tinker with the game's settings on the fly, without using the User Interface</li>
            <li>Sometimes getting access to settings that don't even exist in said UI.</li> 
            <br>Even though Counter-Strike 2 uses the newest Source 2 engine, the console feature is <b>still</b> implemented
            and fully usable. CS2's settings include ALL the customizability you could want, yet some people like myself still prefer to use the console, which 
            can be useful when:
            <br><br><li>Adjusting your own personal settings</li>
            <li>Setting up a community server for you and your friends to play on.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>Let's dive into some of these settings you can learn yourself.

        <p>Good job! Now you have access to the console. At any time you can press the "~" button on your keyboard to pull it up.</p>

        <p>Let's start with something simple such as the media commands.
          <br> Turn on the console.
          <br> The first and easiest command we are going to use is "volume". This lets you adjust, you guessed it: the game's volume. A benefit of using this command
          is that you can tweak the volume more precisely than from the settings. For an example in the settings you can't set the volume to 0.01(0.1 is the minimum
          value available).
          <code>volume 1 //Here you can set any value for the volume from 0-1, using '.' i.e '0.05'</code>
        </p>
        <p>Is the enemy team toxic and irritating? Spamming distracting or simply mean messages? Try this command:
          <code>cl_mute_enemy_team 1 //Set a value from 0(off) to 1(on) - This blocks all communication from the enemy team.</code>
          <br>Are <i>your</i> teammates annoying, too loud and don't even speak English? Use this:
          <code>cl_mute_all_but_friends_and_party 1 //Once again, 0(off), 1(on) - This blocks all communication from everyone that isn't your Steam friend, or from
            your party.
          </code>
        </p>

          </code>
